# ML_Heart_Predictor

## Overview

This initiative aims to assess the risk of heart disease in patients using a range of machine learning techniques. We will explore algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees, along with ensemble methods like stacking, to enhance predictive accuracy.
## Dataset

Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) with 303 samples and 14 features.


## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Stacking
